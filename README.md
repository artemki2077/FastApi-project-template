# FastApi-project-template #

template for FastApi projects

it is constantly inconvenient to create a project in pycharm and re-create folders and files every time, for this I created this repository

# Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/artemki2077/FastApi-project-template.git project_name
cd project_name
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*rename the project
